This repository contains the official guide to using GitHub as a collaborative tool in educational environments.

It is designed for school administrators, teachers, and support staff who want to organize planning, documentation, and activity tracking using GitHub. The goal is not to replace a school management system, but to introduce a fast, flexible, and transparent way to structure academic life.

📘 **What’s included:**

- A complete wiki-based guide with practical steps
- Use of issues, wikis, repositories, and projects
- Examples and best practices
- Templates and structures ready to adapt to your school

## 🌟 Why GitHub?

We believe GitHub is not just for developers - it is a modern, flexible platform for educational institutions.

You can use GitHub to:

- 📚 Document school policies, handbooks, curriculum materials, and procedures
- 📋 Organize the work of teachers, mentors, coordinators, and administrative staff
- 🗓️ Plan and manage internal operations such as schedules, meetings, and school initiatives
- 📆 Coordinate events, student activities, and school-wide projects
- 🚀 Support collaborative projects involving both students and staff
- 💻 Promote digital literacy, transparency, and a culture of documentation across the community

GitHub enables version control, shared editing, structured collaboration, and centralized access — making it a powerful organizational tool at every level of school life.
